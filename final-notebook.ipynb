    "## Overview\n",
    "In this project, I will create a model that can predict if a hotel review is negative or positive so that hotels can use it to classify their reviews correctly. I will analyze a specific hotel in London and compare it to other hotels in London as well. We will walk through multiple Natural Language Processing to understand how we can use machines to read reviews and get insights out of it. Baseline models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Ensemble models include Voting, Bagging, GridSearch, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The final model was a GridSearch SVM with an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-Score 0.8247.\n",

    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest problems that many companies have been trying to overcome is how to take advantage of all the data collected from guests. The amount of data has challenged the travel industry. One type of data is reviews left by guests on websites such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels have been trying to find ways to analyze the reviews and get insights out of them. However, some hotels can receive thousands of guests every week and hundreds of reviews. It becomes nearly impossible and expensive for hotels to keep track of the reviews. Thus, multiple hotels might ignore these valuable data due to the cost and energy that need to be allocated. The other problem is that hotels such as Booking.com don't allow users to choose their score. The score is determined by questions asked to the user, and then the review is calculated. This is problematic because guests could have had a bad experience, and the hotel would still get a 7 or 8 score, which gives a false illusion that the guest didn't have any problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will build a model that can correctly predict if a hotel review is negative or positive so that hotels can input their reviews and get a non-biased score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting the hypothetical scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Our actual client is a hotel in London called Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf. They have thousands of reviews and a 6.7 overall score on Booking.com. They think this is a low score compared to other London hotels, and they want to understand what is causing this low score. Due to COVID-19, they don't have the resources to read all the reviews and make sense of them. Thus, they want to find a way to get quick insights without having to read every review. They have a few business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we create a model that can correctly identify the most important features when predicting if a review is positive or negative for all the reviews we have available? What are these features?\n",
    "- What are the most mentioned words in negative and positive reviews? What insights could they get from them? How would a word cloud for negative and positive reviews look like for their hotel and in comparison to other hotels?\n",
    "- How does the client score performs compared to other hotels in the city?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf?\n",
    "\n",
    "While doing the Exploratory Data Analysis, I noticed that Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf was the hotel with the highest number of reviews. The average score is 6.7, which means that there is probably room for improvement. It is more likely to find different word clouds for negative and positive reviews."

    "The data set was quite organized. However, it had a few challenges. For example, the review was divided between positive and negative reviews. Although this is useful for specific cases, most reviews will not be separated by positive and negative reviews. Thus, creating a model that is able to idenfity positive and negative reviews could be useless if we add reviews that are not separated. Other uses for the model, such as using it in social media would not work. A solution was merging the together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other big challenge with dataset is that the address is a long string, which means that is difficult to collect information such as city and country due to the different formats which is written. This problem was solved grabbing the city and country of the hotel using Geopy."

This could be a problem when modeling. Thus, for the MVP, I decided to use only 20% of the dataset to avoid the curse of dimentionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I had a classification problem, I first created a target feature with the score. In this step I noticed that the lowest score was 2.5 and the highest was 10. Since there were users who wrote that there was anything good about the hotel, I assume that 2.5 was actually given by Booking.com, not the user. Then I converted the score into a classification problem. Since 2.5 was the lowest and 10 the highest, I decided to dived the target in two: positive and negative, where anything below 6 was negative and 6 and above was positive. 6.25 would be the middle point, so I decided to go with 6."

    "I chose the Random Forest as the final model. Although it didn't have the best accuracy, the feature importance are more interpretable. The accuracy of this model was 0.8012, which means that the model can correctly classify the target variable 80.12% of the time. Looking at cross-validation, we can see that the model performed similarly in the train set. I used 5 folds and the range difference between the highest accuracy and lowest accuracy was , which is a very small difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the confusion matrix, we can see that the overall performance is ok. However, it tends to predict more False Positives than False Negatives. There is definitely room for improvement as next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the feature importance, the top 20 words that have the highest importance in the model are negative,\tpositive,\tgreat,\texcellent,\tstaff,\tlocation,\troom,\tfriendly,\tcomfortable,\tpoor,\tbreakfast,\tdirty,\tgood,\thelpful,\tsmall,\tlovely,\tnice,\told,\tbad, and\tperfect. All these words make sense when we are talking about hotels. In fact, they are very similar to the words found in the word cloud."

    "# Final Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "All models were trained with the reviews of over 1,400 hotels. Thus, the model can be used for any hotel because it used over 515k reviews. Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf can use our model to correctly classify reviews at any point. However, the most important takeaways here is the feature importance. Since guests tend to expect for the same things in every hotel, we learned that words such as staff, location, comfortable, and dirty will make have a higher value in their reviews. The words also match to the word cloud create for Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf, which proves that the hotel, similarly to other, need to focus on those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend the hotel start using word clouds to get quick insights from negative and positive reviews. The negative reviews can be used to improve the business and should be used as soon as possible if the hotel wants to increase their overall score. The hotel should also use positive reviews can be used for advertisement, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning can be used to correctly identify positive and negative reviews. However, identify with 100% confidence is difficult.\n",
    "- Word clouds can be used to understand what words appear the most in negative and positive reviews. The management can quickly take a look and get insights out of it.\n",
    "- The Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf performes poorly in the reviews compared to other hotels in London. There is a lot of room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test the model in the whole data set as well as social media posts.\n",
    "- Create a recommendation system to the user based on reviews\n",
    "- Create a dashboard for guests and hotels easily get information about hotels.\n",
