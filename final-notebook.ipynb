    "One of the biggest problems that many companies have been battleling is how to take advantage of all the data that is collected by them. The travel industry has been challenged by the amount of data. One of the types of data is reviews left by guests in websites such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels have been trying to find ways to analyze the reviews and get insights out of it. However, some hotels can receive thousands of guests every week and hundreds of reviews. It becomes nearly impossible and expensive for hotels to keep track of the reviews. Thus, multiple hotels might negligete these valuable data due to the cost and energy that need to be allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, here are a few questions that I will try to answer with this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can machine learning be used to correctly identify positive or negative reviews?\n",
    "- Can NLP be used to create a useful word cloud with the the positive and negative reviews?\n",
    "- How is a specific hotel compared to the other hotels in the same city? Can we find more information about the guests based on their review?"

The raw dataset is from Kaggle. The original dataset had 515,738 observations and 17 columns."

    "The data set was quite organized. However, it had a few challenges. For example, the review was divided between positive and negative reviews. Although this is useful for specific cases, most reviews will not be separated by positive and negative reviews. Thus, creating a model that is able to idenfity positive and negative reviews could be useless if we add reviews that are not separated. Other uses for the model, such as using it in social media would not work. A solution was merging the together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other big challenge with dataset is that the address is a long string, which means that is difficult to collect information such as city and country due to the different formats which is written. This problem was solved grabbing the city and country of the hotel using Geopy."

This could be a problem when modeling. Thus, for the MVP, I decided to use only 20% of the dataset to avoid the curse of dimentionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I had a classification problem, I first created a target feature with the score. In this step I noticed that the lowest score was 2.5 and the highest was 10. Since there were users who wrote that there was anything good about the hotel, I assume that 2.5 was actually given by Booking.com, not the user. Then I converted the score into a classification problem. Since 2.5 was the lowest and 10 the highest, I decided to dived the target in two: positive and negative, where anything below 6 was negative and 6 and above was positive. 6.25 would be the middle point, so I decided to go with 6."

    "## Final Recommendations\n",
    "- Use machine learning models to quickly identify negative and positive reviews without having to read all of them.\n",
    "- Use word clouds to get quick insights from negative and positive reviews. The negative reviews can be used to improve the business and positive reviews can be used for advertisement, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning can be used to correctly identify positive and negative reviews. However, identify with 100% confidence would be extremely difficult.\n",
    "- Word clouds can be used to understand what words appear the most in negative and positive reviews. The management can quickly take a look and get insights out of it.\n",
    "- The Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf performes poorly in the reviews compared to other hotels in London. There is a lot of room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test the model in the whole data set\n",
    "- Use the features of the model with the highest coeficcient to understand which words can predict better if a review is good or not and test\n",
    "- Use the features with the highest coeficcient to predict if posts in social media are positive or negative\n",
    "- Create a recommendation system to the user based on reviews\n",
    "- Create a dashboard for guests and hotels easily get information about hotels.\n",
